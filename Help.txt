SciCalc is a calculator that can solve string equations.
Ex:
z=ANS*{[2*SIN(PI/2)+e²+5E-LN(1)]/n!}.
======================================================
QUICK REFERENCE:
1. Use parenthesis to change the order of operations.
Ex. 2*(2+2)
     =8

2. Lower case letters are for variables a-z, you can set variables with the '=' operator
(NOTE: "e" is reserved for the natural log base)
	Ex. z=(x+2*y)

3. You don't always have to put a '*' (multiplication) operator between letters, numbers,
parenthesis, and function names, but it is recommended that you do:
	Ex.   2ySIN(0)z    <is the same as>    2*y*SIN(0)*z	

4. Uppercase letters are for function names
Trig: SIN, ASIN, COS, ACOS, TAN, ATAN
Logs: LOG, LN, E
Other: SQRT, ABS
	Ex. TAN(4)
	(Trig. functions are in degrees by default, see options)
	Also note that sometimes using PI with trig. functions in radians will not
	yield exact 0 answers where applicable.
	Ex.	5E(-3)
		5E-3
		5*10^-3
		(All = 5000)

5. Letters and words reserved for constants:
ANS	Last answer
PI	3.14159265358979323846264338327950
e	2.7182818281828182
Variables:
a-z	Use '=' operator to assign a value to a variable.
	EX. a=60
		x=2*SIN(a)
	All variables default to a value of 0.

Any value greater or less than 1.79769313486E(308) in magnitude is infinity.
